<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>
Some software applications in the education sector include degree works and schoology.
What distinguishes our web application is its comprehensive approach to deliver useful
information regarding the userâ€™s major to the user. It provides the user with all the credits that
they need to take for their major in an organized manner. It also enables students to access
ratings and feedback on the course and professor from their fellow classmates that have taken
this course. Unlike the other software applications which would require you to go on an external
site to access this information. This software also allows you to have direct access to your
advisor to provide you with guidance and support to have a successful education. Lastly, with
this software you can check how far along you are in your degree with the progress degree bar
which is not provided in most educational software applications
