<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p><
Some software applications in the education sector include degree works and schoology.
What distinguishes our web application is its comprehensive approach to deliver useful
information regarding the userâ€™s major to the user. It provides the user with all the credits that
they need to take for their major in an organized manner. It also enables students to access
ratings and feedback on the course and professor from their fellow classmates that have taken
this course. Unlike the other software applications which would require you to go on an external
site to access this information. This software also allows you to have direct access to your
advisor to provide you with guidance and support to have a successful education. Lastly, with
this software you can check how far along you are in your degree with the progress degree bar
which is not provided in most educational software applications

Software Capabilities:
Subsystem 1:
Features 1-5 - Program Information: This feature provides information about the
university's engineering program(s). It may contain information about various
engineering disciplines, degree types (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.), and admission
requirements. Has a minimum of five different major buttons.
Feature 6 - Graduate Requirements/Credit: Students can obtain thorough information
about specific degree requirements, such as course prerequisites, core courses, elective

to the textbooks for each course. Has a tip regarding any relevant prerequisites. Has
several different ways to filter courses via a dropdown menu.
Features 4-5 - Professor Information: This tool gathers and saves information about the
professors who teach each engineering course. It may include professor names, contact
information, academic qualifications, research interests, and, as previously said, student
ratings or reviews of professors. Has a feature for students to rate and comment about that
class/professor. Has a pop-up displaying professor background information.
Subsystem 3:
Features 1-5 - Advisor Tools: The advisor tool keeps track of academic advisers
associated with the engineering program. You schedule a meeting to discuss several
engineering major opportunities. Has a button to go to the scheduling page. Has a
dropdown to see advisor availability. Has a button to confirm chosen appointment time.
